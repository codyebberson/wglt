Remake of "kusemono", 2011 7drl entry:
http://www.interq.or.jp/libra/oohara/kusemono/index.html

> kusemono is a dungeon exploring game where you rely on stealth and stabbing instead of brute force. You can run so fast that you are blinking in the eye of enemies, you can search for enemies behind a wall and you can kill any unnoticed enemy with one stabbing. You also have some magic devices for emergency need.
